## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Expert Concepts

This project implements Google's standard Android practices and several advanced concepts:

### 1. Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns across domain, data, and UI layers for better scalability and maintainability.

### 2. Modularization
- Project is divided into modules to promote code reusability and support team collaboration.

### 3. Dependency Injection
- Used Hilt for decoupling components and facilitating easier testing.

### 4. Reactive Programming
- Employed Kotlin Flow for handling asynchronous operations efficiently and responsively.

### 5. Continuous Integration
- CI tools were used to automate builds and testing, maintaining app stability during development.

### 6. Memory Leak Detection
- Integrated LeakCanary to detect and resolve memory leaks.

### 7. Code Obfuscation
- Used ProGuard to obfuscate code, adding a layer of protection against reverse engineering.

### 8. Database Encryption
- Applied encryption to local databases to secure user data.

### 9. Certificate Pinning
- Implemented certificate pinning to ensure secure network communications with trusted certificates only.
